      <h3>Higher or Lower?</h3>
      <button id="compare-mode-btn" class="green-button">Play: Higher or Lower</button>
      <p>The game will play two notes. Is the second higher, lower or the same?</p>
      <h3>Notes Of The Major (Ionian) Scale</h3>
      <button id="major-scales-btn" class="green-button">Start: Major Scales</button>
      <p>Select any one of the 12 Major scales and use your mind's ear, and the 'sound'
        of the major scale, to identify the played notes! Don't be overwhelmed at the number
      of possible scales - if you can do this in C Major then other scales
      shouldn't be much more difficult.</p>
      <h3>Chromatic Scale</h3>
      <button id="chromatic-btn" class="green-button">Start: Chromatic Scale - One Octave</button>
      <p>Here we have all chromatic notes. This is much more difficult as we can't simply
        rely on the 'sound', or the tonic, of a Major scale to identify intervals and movements.</p>

        <h2>Select a Major Scale</h2>

      <h3>Major scale with no sharps or flats</h3>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="C">C Major</button>

      <h3>Major scales with sharps (#)</h3>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="G">G Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="D">D Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="A">A Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="E">E Major</button>

      <h3>Major scales with flats (b)</h3>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="F">F Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="Bb">Bb Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="Eb">Eb Major</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="Ab">Ab Major</button>

      <h3>Enharmonic Major Scales</h3>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="B">B Major (Cb Major)</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="F#">F# Major (Gb Major)</button>
      <button class="green-button scale-select" data-scale="C#">C# Major (Db Major)</button>
      <p>Note: enharmonic scales have notes that share the same pitch,
      however these shared pitches could be written with either sharps or flats.
      e.g. in F# Major the second note is 'G#', in Gb major the second note
is 'Ab' - both G# and Ab are the same pitch, we are just labelling them differently.</p>

    <h2>What Is Relative Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      Relative pitch is the ability to identify a pitch, or note,
      when given a reference pitch first - it is different to
      perfect or ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô pitch where an individual can identify a note
      without the need to hear a reference pitch. Perfect pitch is generally
      considered genetic or learned only at a very young age, whereas relative
      picth is a skill that can be developed and improved in almost everyone at any age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relative pitch is what forms the foundation of a good ‚Äòmusical ear‚Äô. If a musician has good relative pitch skills they could listen to a piece of music and figure out the melody notes, or the chord sequence, all in their head.
    </p>
    <h2>This App, and the Major Scale</h2>
    <p>
      This app focusses mostly on learning the sound, or ‚Äòtonality‚Äô, of the Major scale. This is one of the most fundamentally useful musical skills in modern, particularly Western, music, where a significant majority of composition uses the Major scale as its foundational sonic palette - ooo what fancy words! This allows musicians with a solid internalisation of the major scale, and knowledge of basic music theory, the ability to effectively understand and navigate what a piece of music is doing, and move that onto their chosen instruments.
